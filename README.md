# Insight Crime Classifier
 Text classification models using pre-tagged Insight Crime data.

Articles were scraped using the Insight-Crime-Crawler.

The articles collected had too many tags, so we combined multiple tags into reduced labels.

This resulted in 105 tags rather than 253. Still a lot but it performs much better.
